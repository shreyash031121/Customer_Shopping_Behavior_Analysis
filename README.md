# Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis
End-to-end customer behavior analysis using Python for data cleaning, SQL for querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboarding.
# Customer Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow. The objective is to analyze customer behavior by cleaning and exploring data in Python, performing analytical queries using SQL, and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The project follows a real-world ETL process used in data analytics roles.

## Dataset
- Customer-level dataset containing purchase behavior and review-related information
- Raw data loaded and explored using Python
- Cleaned and transformed data stored in a SQL database for analysis

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning
- SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Table creation and analytical queries
- Power BI – Interactive dashboard and data visualization
- Gamma – Presentation and insight storytelling
- CSV / Excel – Source data format

## Project Workflow
1. Loaded the dataset in Python and inspected data structure
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and issues
3. Cleaned and transformed the data in Python
4. Transferred cleaned data from Python to a SQL database
5. Created tables and ran SQL queries to answer business questions
6. Connected Power BI directly to the SQL database
7. Built an interactive dashboard with KPIs and insights
8. Created a detailed report and presentation using Gamma

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard highlights:
- Total number of customers
- Average purchase amount
- Average review rating
- Customer behavior trends and insights

The dashboard is fully interactive and connected to the SQL database

---

## Results & Insights
- Identified key customer behavior patterns
- Analyzed purchase trends and customer ratings
- Generated actionable insights for business decision-making

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Python notebook for data cleaning and EDA
3. Load the cleaned data into a SQL database
4. Execute SQL queries for analysis
5. Open Power BI and connect to the SQL database
6. Refresh the dashboard to view insights
